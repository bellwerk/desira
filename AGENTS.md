## Codex review focus
- Auth & permission issues (Supabase RLS + server checks)
- Input validation on all mutations (Zod)
- Stripe Connect correctness (destination charges, transfers)
- Secrets/PII leakage (logs, client bundles)
- TypeScript safety (no any, no unsafe casts)
- Next.js App Router best practices (server/client boundaries)
